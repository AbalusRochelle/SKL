Hello!
My name is Rochelle Faith M. Abalus and I have a few nicknames but I prefer to be called "Chi" for it is shorter and more unique.
I am born and raised in the province of Quirino in Region II.
Yes, I know that a lot of people in the city were not familiar of the place where I came from, and I am actually suprised because
Quirino is really far from Manila and it takes 6-10 hours of land travel to get there.
It is really questionable why I chose to study at UST but for me, UST is a dream school. I don't just want to be an engineer,
I want to be a Thomasian engineer. Few of the things that I love are dogs, home decorations and interiors, and food.
I am introvert and pessimistic in almost everything.  That is everything I can share about myself.
